Hey Guys! Welcome to my first Shiny App.

The URL of the APP is: https://awutang89.shinyapps.io/PredictCPM/

The goal of this app is to predict the cost per month (CPM) of your gas. In the application, you have 4 input fields that help predict
the cost of gas for that month. The mpg of your car is predicted by a linear regression model from the weight and the cylinders of the car.

The inputs:
1. Miles Driven Per Month - Make sure to enter the total numbers you drove during that month.
2. Cost of Gas - Make sure to write down the cost of gas in US dollars/gallon.
3. Weight of Car - This is in 1000 lbs units. If your car is 3000 lbs, then the weight would be equal to 3.
4. Cylinders in Engine - Most cars have total cylinders between 4,6, and 8. If you have more you are too rich and don't need this calculator.

The output in the main panel will show you much your estimated cost of gas will be for the month. 
Gas prices do fluctuate so the predictions aren't perfect. In the main panel, there is a plot of the data where mpg was predicted.

Have fun!
